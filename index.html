  <h2>Dolphins are extremely intelligent. Apparently, dolphins are as smart as apes, and the evolution of their brains is very similar to that of humans. Dolphins can recognize themselves in the mirror, and after humans, dolphins are considered the second most intelligent mammals on the planet.
</h2>
<h2>Dolphins do not use their teeth to chew, instead they use their teeth to catch their food and then they swallow it whole. Do dolphins drink water? Dolphins do not drink water like humans. Instead dolphins get all the fresh water from the fish they eat!
</h2>
<h2>Dolphins are very friendly with humans and share a great bond, they love to play on the surface of the water. Dolphins can have between 74-104 teeth but they never chew their food. They reproduce sexually and are known to give birth to calves (the name for a dolphin baby) once every two to three years.</h2>
